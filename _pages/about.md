I'm a postdoctoral research fellow in cognitive neuroscience at The University of Melbourne. I use neurophysiological (EEG), computational, and behavioural approachs to study how our brains make sense of visual information. My current work focusses on predictive delay-compensation mechanisms. These enable us to feel as if we are living in the present moment, rather than lagging behind the world, despite neural transmission and sensory processing delays. 

I currently work in the [Time in Brain and Behaviour Lab](https://psychologicalsciences.unimelb.edu.au/research/msps-research-groups/timing) at The University of Melbourne with [Hinze Hogendoorn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uOh2Ik0AAAAJ&hl=en&inst=4522501446918153378&oi=ao). Previously, I completed my PhD in the [Decision Neuroscience Lab](https://dlab.unimelb.edu.au/) under the supervision of [Stefan Bode](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nPX76iMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Rob Hester](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=vma8HZ0AAAAJ) investigating perceptual decision making and metacognition.
