Hello! I'm a postdoctoral research fellow in cognitive neuroscience. I study how our brains make sense of visual information, with a particular focus on predictive delay-compensation mechanisms. In other words, I'm studying why we don't feel as if we are lagging behind the 'outside' world, despite the delays inherent in visual processing.

I work in the [Timing Lab](https://psychologicalsciences.unimelb.edu.au/research/msps-research-groups/timing) at The University of Melbourne, Australia. I previously completed my PhD in the [Decision Neuroscience Lab](https://dlab.unimelb.edu.au/) where I studied perceptual decision making, metacognition, and 'changes of mind'.
