As a fun exercise I translated George Mather's [motion energy filtering demo](http://www.georgemather.com/Model.html) from MATLAB into Python. 

The GitHub repo with Python code and stimulus files can be found [here](https://github.com/bootstrapbill/motion-energy-python-translation). 

### What is motion energy filtering?
A surprisingly powerful observation is that motion manifests as oriented structure in space-time. If you're reading about this for the first time and that feels completely incomprehensible (it certainly was for me!) I'd recommend checking out this [blog](https://jake.vision/blog/motion-illusions/) by Jacob Yates, which does a far better job of explaining things than I ever could. Seriously, go check it out, it's impressively entertaining AND informative.

Motion energy filtering involves building detectors ('filters') which are sensitive to orientation in space-time, providing a beautifully simple means of detecting motion. To make things extra interesting, its generally thought that this is what our visual system does to sense movement!

I've plotted the filters generated in the demo, below. Notice how they contain diagonally oriented streaks... that's essentially what enables them to look for oriented structure in space time (i.e., motion)! In fact, if you cycle through each time-slice (row) of the filters you see what looks like 'pulses' of motion in the leftwards and rightwards direction. Jacob's [blog](https://jake.vision/blog/motion-illusions/) has a really nice demo of this.

The original paper on motion energy filtering by Adelson and Bergen can be found [here](https://opg.optica.org/josaa/fulltext.cfm?uri=josaa-2-2-284&id=1945). It's somewhat dense, but is truly a beautiful paper once you wrap your head around things. I'd recommend reading it after going through Jacob's blog, before diving into the Python code.

### Additional resources

The current demo considers 1D motion. For more complex (2D motion) implementations see [this MATLAB toolbox](https://github.com/anne-urai/motion_energy_filtering) by Anne Urai and Klaus Wimmer, which also contains links to additional resources. 

Finally, please let me know if you spot any issues with my translation (my email can be found on the sidebar).
