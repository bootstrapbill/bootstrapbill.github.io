This is a quick guide on how I made this very website (so you can make one too!). 

**What kind of website is this?**

This is a static website (really just a collection of files) built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) template. It's hosted for free (!) on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) hence the funky (some might say cool?!) 'github.io' address. 

**What does is cost?**

Zero dollars... &#129327; 

All you need is a bit of time up your sleeve (it took me ~1-2 hrs to get a basic site up and running). 

**What coding knowledge is required?**

All that's required is some familiarity with using a git client (I used [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)) and a willingness to google [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) formatting issues until you get what you want. If you have no idea what Markdown and git are don't fear... learning the basics of both is actually quite simple, so building a website like this is still very doable! 

To ease you into things, we will use a git client (think dropbox for code) to transfer all the required website files onto our computer. We will then edit and personalise some of these newly acquired files, using the Markdown language to specify text formatting! Then we will use our git client to pop those edited files back on the web for people to look at, in the form of our new website. That's pretty much it!

  Heck yeah  Read on...

**Here's what you need to do:**

1. Make sure you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. If you don't have one then... make one! Also bear in mind that your username becomes the initial part of your website address, so you probably want to pick a professional looking username (or end up with one like mine &#128556;) 

2. Make sure you have a git client installed (or do everything through terminal if you're into that!). If you want to follow in my footsteps exactly then use [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). Download the app, make an account and link it to your GitHub. In case you need a refresher, we will use SourceTree to move files from GitHub onto your computer so we can then edit them and then later to upload the freshly edited files back onto the web! 

3. For the initial website building process I'd recommend you just follow [this excellent guide](https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/06/academic-website/) by Rob Williams. Its very clear and beautiful. Note, however, that I deviated from this guide slightly. I opted to just push my edited files onto the web immediately (using SourceTree) and fix bugs that I saw in the online version with subsequent pushes, rather than testing my website 'locally' (i.e. behind closed doors). I found this much easier, but in doing so you do run the risk of someone catching a glimpse of your mangled half-built website, so beware! 

4. Just in case you have ignored my advice to go follow Rob's guide, here's a sketch of the steps involved... in Rob's guide:
	1. ['Fork'](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the academicpages repository into your GitHub (this just means we make our own copy of the original bunch of files, to do whatever we want with). 
	2. ['Clone'](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the newly forked repository from your GitHub onto your computer (this just means we create a 'local' copy of the repository... kind of like downloading everything onto your computer). We do this so we can then edit the files. I did all of this with... you guessed it, SourceTree!
	3. Edit the relevant files. I started by editing the '_config.yml' file (following... Rob's guide). Then I edited the 'about.md' file (in the 'pages' folder) to add in a blurb about myself. Finally I added my profile photo into the images folder to replace the original 'profile.png' file. 
	4. For the initial version of my website I decided to just have an 'about me' page with links to my twitter, google scholar and github accounts on the left-hand side and nothing else. So I went to the 'data' folder and edited the 'navigation.yml' file to remove all the links to other pages at the top of the website. To do this you just have to put a hash ('#') in front of the lines you don't want (see photo below). 

<img src=../images/remove_navigation.png widht = "10">


**Getting fancy**

I later came back to my husk of a website and decided to add in my publications at the bottom of the 'about me' page. 

Here's a snapshot of the code I added in to the 'about.md' file to achieve this (this adds in the first two publications I have listed).

1. Ko, Feuerriegel, **Turner**, Overhoff, Niessen, Stahl, Hester, Fink, Weiss, & Bode (2022). Divergent effects of absolute evidence magnitude on decision accuracy and confidence in perceptual judgements. *Cognition*. <a href="../files/Ko_et_al_2022.pdf"><i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i></a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027722001135?dgcid=coauthor"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a> <a href="https://osf.io/r8vfx/"><i class="fas fa-code"></i></a>

With a bit of googling I worked out how to use some simple HTML to add in fancy icons like this <i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i>. I use this icon as a link to a pdf copy of my papers which I put in the 'files' folder on my computer (and then pushed onto GitHub with... yep, SourceTree). Amazingly, you don't need to install anything extra to use icons like this, just use my HTML code from my example above. You can search to see what other icons are available on the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) website.
